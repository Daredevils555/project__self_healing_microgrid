# Embedded Safety Systems

This repository contains embedded and IoT-based projects focused on safety-critical system design, fault detection, and automated response mechanisms. The work reflects a progression from distributed sensing to autonomous system recovery.

### Self-Healing Microgrid
A distributed microgrid prototype designed to detect electrical faults and autonomously restore power using relay-based isolation, sensor feedback, and CAN-based communication between nodes.

## Scope
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers (ESP32)
- IoT and distributed sensing
- Fault detection and recovery logic
- Safety-critical system design

## Academic Context
These projects were developed as part of the Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) curriculum for academic learning and demonstration purposes.
